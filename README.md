## 1. Installation & Dependency Resolution

Clone or extract the repository, open your terminal / command prompt in the project directory (`C:\Users\HP\Downloads\yasheos---premium-footwear-store`), and install dependencies:

```bash
# Recommended command:
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

> **Note on ERESOLVE peer dependency error**:
> If you previously ran `npm install` and saw `npm error code ERESOLVE (peerOptional esbuild from vite)`, this happens in npm 7+ when peer dependency versions have strict ranges across plugins. Running:
> ```bash
> npm install --legacy-peer-deps
> ```
> resolves all packages cleanly without conflict.
